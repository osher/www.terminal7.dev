  text: >
    Welcome to Terminal7, a terminal app
    for the new era of Personal Computing.
    At its core, Terminal7 is a reincarnation of tmux based on a novel architecture with
    a rich client, a simple server and secure and real time communications.
    Here are the key additions:<br/>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> WebRTC for secure UDP based protocol<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Local scroll & copy-mode<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Touch gestures for easiest layout control<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Per pane font size for small logs & large code<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Live camera feed in a pane<br>

    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for
    performance and security.

    WebRTC is great, but it requires a signalling server to estalish sessions and go behind-the-NAT.
    In ~15% of the cases it also requires a relay server as "NAT hole punching"
    fails. Terminal7 PeerBook subscription gives you all that and an 2FA protected
    address book of clients & servers. Our a world-wide network of relay servers (TURN) is provided
    by Twilio.
