    Welcome to Terminal7 - an open source terminal app
    for the new era of Personal Computing.

    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for
    performance, security and reach. <br>
    Terminal7 let's you seamlessly switch from your deskop
    to your tablet and vice-versa making it easy to roam
    and become a local nomad.

    WebRTC is great, but it requires a signalling server to estalish sessions and reach behind-the-NAT servers.
    In ~15% of the cases it also requires a relay server as "hole punching"
    fails. Terminal7 PeerBook subscription gives you all that and a 2FA protected
    address book of clients & servers.<br/>
    With PeerBook you'll never have to key a IP address ever again.
