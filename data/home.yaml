    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for
    performance and security.

    Terminal7 has an optional online service - peerbook.
    It's a signaling server and a world-wide network of relay servers (TURN) that
    extends Terminal7's reach to behind-the-NAT servers.

    peerbook is offered as a paid subscription for ~$30 a year with a month's trial
