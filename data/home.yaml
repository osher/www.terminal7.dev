    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for

    Terminal7 comes with an address book and signaling service - peerbook.io .
    It includes web socket signalling server that speeds up connection time and
    extends Terminal7's reach to dynamic IP server and behind-the-NAT. 
    With peerbook you can use your desktop or Raspberry Pi
    and save on hosting costs.
