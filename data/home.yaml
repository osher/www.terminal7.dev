    Welcome to Terminal7 - an open source terminal app
    for the new era of Personal Computing.
    Terminal7 is a reincarnation of tmux based on a novel architecture with
    a rich client, a simple server and secure, real time communications.
    <br/>Hers are its key additions:<br/>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> WebRTC for secure UDP based protocol<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Local scroll & copy-mode<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Touch gestures for easiest layout control<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Per pane font size for small logs & large code<br>
    <span class='padding-right-8'>•</span> Live camera feed for conferencing & recording<br>

    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for
    performance, security and reach. With T7 you can access
    your servers from any approved browser, seamlessly switching from a deskop
    to the mobile and vice-versa.

    WebRTC is great, but it requires a signalling server to estalish sessions and go behind-the-NAT.
    In ~15% of the cases it also requires a relay server as "NAT hole punching"
    fails. Terminal7 PeerBook subscription gives you all that and a 2FA protected
    address book of clients & servers.
