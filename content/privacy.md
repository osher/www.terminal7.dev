this policy.

provide it to us, such as when contacting us, or where it is required to
provide you with the services.

## What Non-Personal Data Do We Retain?
Non Personal Data might not specifically be considered as Personal Data, but
alongside other pieces of data it may allow others to deduct information. For

collected from various sources. It may include both information that you
voluntarily disclose and information collected from outside sources. In our
service, we collect the data you provide us using the service

not spam you; in our case, you can always opt-out.

incidents even if it is not required. In our case, while the applicable law
does not require that we report we provide our users with data breach
