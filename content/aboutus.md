## Our History

Terminal7 started as Benny's COVID project. Benny loved his iPad Pro, but the
terminal apps were not up to par. Realizing that a tablet-based terminal needs
a revised architecture, he started Terminal7.

## Our Mission

We're working
together as an independent workshop, shooting for immortality through the development
of sharp, polished and open dev tools.

## Sustainability

Our revenue comes from Terminal7's complementing services.
The first one is PeerBook a WebRTC signaling and address book service for developers.
 PeerBook subscription is currently at $30/year with
a 14-day free trial.
