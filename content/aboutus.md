## Our History

Terminal7 started as Benny's COVID project. Benny loved his iPad Pro, but the
terminal apps were becoming a pain. Realizing that a tablet-based terminal needs
a revised architecture, he started Terminal7.

## Our Mission

We're working
together as an independent workshop, looking for immortality through the development
of sharp & polished tools and providing the services they need.
We believe in the Terminal in Open Source and in small businesses. 

Our revenue comes from selling Terminal7 subscriptions. The first one is an
online service - peerbook.io - that allows Terminal7 to run over WebRTC and
enjoy its many benefits.
