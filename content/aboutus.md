## Our beliefs

We believe in the Terminal and in Open Source communities
and we're working together as an independent workshop
not looking for investors nor exits.

Our revenue comes from selling Terminal7 subscriptions.
First one is an online service - peerbook.io - that lets Terminal7
run over WebRTC and enjoy its many benefits.
