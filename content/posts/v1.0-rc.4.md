It's been a busy summer for us, coding all of 1.0 features and revamping the U[IX]. 
Adi helped draw a terminal map to replace the home page while
Eyal has been busy developing a form system for your input.

The forms use a special terminal - TWR - which is also used for notifications.
We tried to keep the interface simple and intuitive
but There are still a few bugs and glitches to iron out.

Here's what we found so far:

- TWR is stuck with tiny font: Not sure why, but there's a fix: 
  bring TWR to the foreground (Cmd-L to toggle) and then switch to another app
  and back.

- Empty screen. Usually after restore from sleep. Taping on the map should
  solve this.

- Flashing TWR. Pretty rear and we're still hunting this one.
If it bites you, we're sorry, but please take a short break
and document your flow as a comment in
[this issue](https://github.com/tuzig/terminal7/issues/287).


If you find other bugs or have an idea on how to make T7 better, please
go through T7's [issues](https://github.com/tuzig/terminal7/issues)
and search for it. If you found it please
comment or give it a thumbs up.
If you haven't found it, please feel free to open an issue.

We're also releasing an improved webexec - 0.17.7. There's just one change
there - we've moved our run files to `~/.local/run` and log to `~/.local/log`. 
To upgrade your server run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.webexec.sh)"
```

Happy New Year,

Benny.
