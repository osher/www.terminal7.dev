Greetings Terminal7 users,

I am excited to introduce you to Version 1.6 of Terminal7, the terminal designed
for the tablet age. With this latest release, we have made some significant
changes to enhance your experience and offer even more powerful features.

One of the major updates in Version 1.6 is the division of Terminal7 into two
distinct versions: a free version and an online service. The free version, which
is now available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/terminal7/id1532882447), 
supports only SSH connections. You can connect to any SSH server and take
advantage of a range of features: a local multiplexer, camera pane,
touch gestures, true colors, nerd fonts and more. Additionally, we have added
biometric authentication for added convenience and security.

For users seeking extreme mobility, we are launching the PeerBook service.
This subscription-based online service provides WebRTC peer discovery and connection
establishment. This means your data goes over UDP and encrypted using the DTLS protocol.
The online service also offers a relay network,
supporting access to servers behind the NATs and mobile networks. To provide an extra layer of
security, the service includes a two-factor authentication (2FA) secured address
book, allowing you to store up to 20 peers.

Please try the version out and let us know how it goes in our discord server's `#feedback`

Benny
