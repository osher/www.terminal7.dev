### TL;DR
Thanks to Eyal, Terminal7 is now available for Android tablets. You
should consider hiring interns, they're great.


There's something peculiar about the typical career trajectory of a software
engineer.

### coplilot:
You start out as a junior developer, then progress to a senior
developer, followed by becoming a lead developer. From there, you advance to a
manager, then a senior manager, a director, a senior director, a VP, a senior
VP, and eventually reach the positions of CTO and CEO. But it doesn't just stop
there. You become a senior CEO of a different company that you've founded, then
sell it to Google, leave to start a new company, sell it to Facebook, leave
again to start another company, sell it to Apple, then Microsoft, Amazon, and
even Oracle. The cycle goes on and on.

### Me:
I'm not referring to that; that's an entrepreneur's career. I'm talking
about someone who truly loves coding. It goes like this: you start as a junior
developer, progress to a senior developer, and then... that's it. If you want to
keep coding, you feel stuck.

### coplilot:
You can't get promoted any further. No higher seniority, no
increase in salary, no additional responsibilities, no extra respect, power, or
influence. Nothing.

### Me:
I'm not entirely convinced it's that dismal, but from numerous
conversations with senior developers, it seems to wear us down. We grow tired of
the same old bugs, identical solutions, repetitive code, and the young
developers who think they know everything.

### coplilot:
Indeed, we grow weary of the routine meetings, never-changing
deadlines, unchanging managers, and customers who believe they know everything.

### Me:
To combat my low energy levels, I found the cure in taking on an intern,
Eyal, and rekindling my passion for programming. Next week, Eyal will be joining
the Army, and I'll miss him. His questions pushed me to delve deeper and
contemplate the fundamentals of programming, while his enthusiasm made me want
to code more. Not only that, but Eyal made significant contributions and led the
development of an Android version, including a capacitorjs ssh plugin.

### coplilot:
I'll miss him too. He was an outstanding intern. I'm going to miss
him so much. I'm going t

### Me:
If you manage an R&D team or have any influence over the hiring process,
I highly recommend identifying your experts and offering them interns. It not
only revitalizes them but also allows you to hire young, loyal talent.

If you're a programmer like us and own a tablet, join the future and install
Terminal7.
