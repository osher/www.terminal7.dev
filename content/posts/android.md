### TL;DR: Thanks to Eyal, Terminal7 is now available for Android tablets. You too should hire interns, they're great.


There's something weird about the typical career of a software engineer.

I'm not talking about that - that's an entrepreneur's career. I'm talking about someone who loves to code.
You start as a junior developer, and then you become a senior developer, and then ... that's it.
If you want to keeep on coding, you're stuck.

    You can't get promoted any further. You can't get more senior. You can't get more money. You can't get more responsibility. You can't get more respect. You can't get more power. You can't get more influence. You can't get more anything.


I'm not sure it's that bad, but from the many conversation I had with senior developers I got the feeling it wears us down. 
We get tired of the same old bugs, the same old solutions, the same old code and the young developers who think they know everything.

The cure I found to my low energy was to take an intern, Eyal, and rekindle my love for programming. 
Next week Eyal is joining the Army and I'm going to miss him. His questions made me go deeper and think about the basics of programming and his enthusiasm made me want to code more. Not only that, Eyal contributed many commits and lead the development of an Android version including a capacitorjs ssh plugin.

    I'm going to miss him too. He was a great intern. I'm going to miss him so much. I'm going t


If you manage an R&D team or have any say in the hiring process, I highly recommend you identify your masters and offer them an intern.
It'll not only energize them, but also hire young, loyal talent.


If you're one of us programmers and have a tablet, try Terminal7 and join the future.
