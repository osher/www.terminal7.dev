### TL;DR
Thanks to Eyal, Terminal7 is now available for Android tablets. You
should consider hiring interns, they're great.


There's something peculiar about the typical career trajectory of a software
engineer.

### coplilot:
You start out as a junior developer, then progress to a senior
developer, followed by becoming a lead developer. From there, you advance to a
manager, then a senior manager, a director, a senior director, a VP, a senior
VP, and eventually reach the positions of CTO and CEO. But it doesn't just stop
there. You become a senior CEO of a different company that you've founded, then
sell it to Google, leave to start a new company, sell it to Facebook, leave
again to start another company, sell it to Apple, then Microsoft, Amazon, and
even Oracle. The cycle goes on and on.

### Me:
I'm not referring to that; that's an entrepreneur's career. I'm talking
about someone who truly loves coding. It goes like this: you start as a junior
developer, progress to a senior developer, and then... that's it. If you want to
keep coding, you feel stuck.

### coplilot:
You can't get promoted any further. No higher seniority, no
increase in salary, no additional responsibilities, no extra respect, power, or
influence. Nothing.

### Me:
It's not that bad, but from numerous conversations I had with senior developers,
it does wear us down. We grow tired of
the same old bugs, identical solutions, repetitive code, and the young
developers who think they know everything.

### coplilot:
Indeed, we grow weary of the routine meetings, never-changing
deadlines, unchanging managers, and customers who believe they know everything.

### Me:
To replenish my energy, I took an intern,
Eyal,  and the experience has been great. Eyal rekindled my passion for programming.
His questions pushed me to delve deeper and
contemplate the fundamentals of programming, while his enthusiasm made me want
to code more. Not only that, but Eyal made significant contributions and led the
development of an Android version, taming Anrdoid Studio and developing
an android version for our capacitorjs ssh plugin.


It's been a great year and I'm sorry to see Eyal leaving us to join the army.
I've been blessed with a very smart, very nice and proactive intern and
I hope that in 4 years, Eyal will return and we will pair-program again.

### coplilot:
I'll miss him too. He was an outstanding intern. I'm going to miss
him so much. I'm going t

### Me:
Me too. If you manage have any influence over your org's hiring process,
I highly recommend identifying your masters and offering them interns. It
revitalizes the veterans and attracts young talent and earns their loyalty.


If you're a programmer and own a tablet with a keyboard, join the future and install
Terminal7.
