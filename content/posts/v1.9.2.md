Greetings Earthlings!

I hope this version finds you well. This version was developed as I was field testing
Terminal7 on a customer's engagement. 
It includes:

- Fixing a reconnect bug
- Extening default history buffer to 10K lines
- Rendering engine upgrade
- Halting retry attempts when network is down

We've also added the new support command that send your report together with
terminal7's log to our support system. Please use it when you find bugs or things are funny.
