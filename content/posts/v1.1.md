title: "Terminal7 1.1 - WebRTC signalling over SSH & CLI
date: 2022-11-30T00:37:49-03:00
---

This version has a few bug fix and two big feature:

- WebRTC singalling over SSH - All sessions starts with SSH.
Then, Terminal7 tries to run `webexec accept`. If webexec is not
found it falls back to SSH and the session is an SSH one.
If the command succeeds client & server start sending each other
possible addresses. When a connection is made the SSH session is closed
and WebRTC rules.

- CLI - The Tower now as a tiny shell (or a bot?) that accepts a few
commands like add, connect, reset. These commands are used by the GUI
to run the user's command. If, for example, you hit the reset button,
the CLI is activate as if you keyed `reset <gate_name`>

If you find other bugs or have an idea on how to make T7 better, please
go through T7's [issues](https://github.com/tuzig/terminal7/issues)
and search for it. If you found it please
comment or give it a thumbs up.
If you haven't found it, please feel free to open an issue.

We're also releasing an improved webexec - 0.17.10. It has some bug fixes
and improvments for the accept comman.
To upgrade your server run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.webexec.sh)"
```
